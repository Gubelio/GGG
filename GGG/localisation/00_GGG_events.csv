EVTNAME50004;The Age of the State;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC50004;Recently, a certain group of new political theorists in $COUNTRY$, stimulated, they say, by a reflection upon the perennial disorders of war, industrial recession, famine, inefficiency, have diagnosed the source of society's ills as not one of inequality or political radicalism, but one of 'anarchy'. Growing out of social liberationist speculation, they have arrived at the conclusion that despite the correct impulses of liberationism, the current state cannot correctly support its intentions. Claiming the current state is ill suited to deal with modern material civilization - the various industrial innovations that have reshaped the economic and attendant social order of the day - they propose a radical reorganization of the state along the lines of the most efficient industrial and corporate enterprises. Endorsing all reforms to rid the state of inefficiency, by means centralized planning, a needed expression of state bureaucracy, rationalization of legislation, elimination of autonomy, etc, the 'statist' ideology demands that the state itself be rationalized to save the gains of social libertarianism from the new ills of inefficiency and the vagaries of the market.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME50005;The Doctrine of Absolutism;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC50005;Ever since the increased agitation of statist reforms and political organization, a new, more virulent and extreme form of statism has emerged from a circle of intellectuals in $COUNTRY$ out of frustration with the statist impulse to compromise with and even protect Liberationist reforms. Turning their back on statism's roots as a means for the preservation of social Liberationism, they have come to suggest that the state itself is an 'absolute' good, an entity that serves no greater good than itself. They cry that the efficiency and capacity of the state must be enforced and pursued 'absolutely', with total indifference to petty squabbling and selfish demands of its constituents. This, they claim, will ultimately, and exclusively, bring true prosperity to those members of the state, unlike the illusions of other ideologies which bring only selfish gain to certain members of the state. Ultimately the absolutist impulse is a radical reformulation and indeed clarification of the purpose and even very being of the state: the state should be seen as an enterprise that succeeds or fails in the preservation and expansion of its own power, capacity, and efficiency, and nothing else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME50006;The First Theocratist Synod;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC50006;The principles of conservatism and reaction have long languished in the doldrums of opposition and desperate compromise. Now, however, we are seeing the revival of the forces of reaction. The 'theocratist' speculators of $COUNTRY$ make radical claims: everywhere, fat and useless bureaucracies deliver grains to idle vagrants and wastrels who have been uprooted from their ancestral homes, great slum tenements have risen up in our once bright cities, the humble farmer is ruined by the slump in the prices of commodities, and mankind wallows, spiritually blighted by this atheistic age of worldly delights. And so a voice hearkens for the halcyon days of yore, when each man knew his station and worked the land of a fatherly lord. A day when each man did not indulge in strange, synthetic compounds, or interpret scriptures in his own degenerate way, but listened to the strictures of the educated priest. But how to achieve this, in such an age of markets and factories? The theocratist ideology claims that the authoritarian and centralizing implements of the modern state pioneered by statism must be employed in fact explicitly for the sake of moral edification and social order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
