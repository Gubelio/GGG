EVTNAME50004;The Age of the State;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC50004;Recently, a certain group of new political theorists in $COUNTRY$, stimulated, they say, by a reflection upon the perennial disorders of war, industrial recession, famine, inefficiency, have diagnosed the source of society's ills as not one of inequality or political radicalism, but one of 'anarchy'. Growing out of social liberationist speculation, they have arrived at the conclusion that despite the correct impulses of liberationism, the current state cannot correctly support its intentions. Claiming the current state is ill suited to deal with modern material civilization - the various industrial innovations that have reshaped the economic and attendant social order of the day - they propose a radical reorganization of the state along the lines of the most efficient industrial and corporate enterprises. Endorsing all reforms to rid the state of inefficiency, by means centralized planning, a needed expression of state bureaucracy, rationalization of legislation, elimination of autonomy, etc, the 'statist' ideology demands that the state itself be rationalized to save the gains of social libertarianism from the new ills of inefficiency and the vagaries of the market.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT50004OPTA;Fascinating;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME50005;The Doctrine of Absolutism;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC50005;Ever since the increased agitation of statist reforms and political organization, a new, more virulent and extreme form of statism has emerged from a circle of intellectuals in $COUNTRY$ out of frustration with the statist impulse to compromise with and even protect Liberationist reforms. Turning their back on statism's roots as a means for the preservation of social Liberationism, they have come to suggest that the state itself is an 'absolute' good, an entity that serves no greater good than itself. They cry that the efficiency and capacity of the state must be enforced and pursued 'absolutely', with total indifference to petty squabbling and selfish demands of its constituents. This, they claim, will ultimately, and exclusively, bring true prosperity to those members of the state, unlike the illusions of other ideologies which bring only selfish gain to certain members of the state. Ultimately the absolutist impulse is a radical reformulation and indeed clarification of the purpose and even very being of the state: the state should be seen as an enterprise that succeeds or fails in the preservation and expansion of its own power, capacity, and efficiency, and nothing else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT50005OPTA;How peculiar;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME50006;The First Theocratist Synod;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC50006;The principles of conservatism and reaction have long languished in the doldrums of opposition and desperate compromise. Now, however, we are seeing the revival of the forces of reaction. The 'theocratist' speculators of $COUNTRY$ make radical claims: everywhere, fat and useless bureaucracies deliver grains to idle vagrants and wastrels who have been uprooted from their ancestral homes, great slum tenements have risen up in our once bright cities, the humble farmer is ruined by the slump in the prices of commodities, and mankind wallows, spiritually blighted by this atheistic age of worldly delights. And so a voice hearkens for the halcyon days of yore, when each man knew his station and worked the land of a fatherly lord. A day when each man did not indulge in strange, synthetic compounds, or interpret scriptures in his own degenerate way, but listened to the strictures of the educated priest. But how to achieve this, in such an age of markets and factories? The theocratist ideology claims that the authoritarian and centralizing implements of the modern state pioneered by statism must be employed in fact explicitly for the sake of moral edification and social order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME50007;A Country Mobilized;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC50007;Conscripts are being drafted left and right and the poor are being trained and prepared to fight. Military camps are full of fresh recruits, troops are carrying out exercises in our borders and every aspect of society and every signal the government gives seems to indicate a war is in progress, yet there's no war. This large disruption in the country's daily life is angering our population and making our neighbours increasingly wary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT50007OPTA;These are just harmless exercises.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC50017;I pledge you, I pledge myself to a new deal for the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ people. Let us here assembled constitute ourselves prophets of a new order of competence and courage. This is more than a political campaign, it is a call to arms...\n\nA spokesperson of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government was quoted saying as the matter of the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ debt exploded in the press. They went bankrupt again, defying previous treaties and now there's talk of military intervention to make sure we will get paid.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT50017OPTA;We are ready to move from the conference to the battlefield table.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME50018;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Defaults!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC50018;Any lack of confidence in the economic future of $FROMCOUNTRY$ is foolish, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ ruler was quoted as saying, "I do not believe that the power and the duty of the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Government ought to be extended to the relief of individual suffering.... The lesson should be constantly enforced that though the people support the Government, the Government should not support the people."\n\nAs the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ defaults on their debts, the civil servants and the economy are suffering greatly from austerity measures. They owed us some money when they defaulted but since the amount is small, we wouldn't normally take any action. We can choose to act, but not forgiving such a small debt will get some worried and angry reactions from the Great Powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT50018OPTA;$FROMCOUNTRY$ better pay their debts from now on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC50019;Wave after wave of selling again moved down prices on the Stock Exchange today and billions of pounds were clipped from values. Traders surged about brokerage offices watching their holdings wiped out.... It was one of the worst breaks in history.... For a time, in the morning, the market was showing signs of rallying power.... Then new waves of selling out of poorly margined accounts started another reaction...\n\n$FROMCOUNTRY$ has gone bankrupt and defaulted on all their debts. We must use our military might if we want to safeguard our investors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME50020;$PROVINCENAME$ Old Naval Base;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC50020;A half abandoned leviathan stuck in the coast. That is how locals in $PROVINCENAME$ describe the decrepit facilities of the old naval base that used to be a local asset strategically important for the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government. In truth, the naval base has been in decline for a long while and the government defaulting is just the rock bottom. Hit with a severe economic recession in $YEAR$, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ politicians in $CAPITAL$ have no money to spend on repairing and maintaining non-essential staff and facilities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME50021;Overgrown Railways in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC50021;What once was one of the arteries of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ industry, the railway in $PROVINCENAME$ fell into such disrepair that it's path is barely visible and its tracks are unusable. Economic recession has hit $STATENAME$ harshly for the last years and without money from $CAPITAL$ being invested, most of the railways in $STATENAME$ are in such a state that they will need to be rebuilt to become train-worthy again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME50022;Forts Close in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC50022;If one in $YEAR$ were to look at the state of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ line of defences in $PROVINCENAME$, what they would see is a multitude of abandoned bases and unmanned fortifications occupied only by squatters. A fortification is something tricky to maintain - not only it needs regular assessment of the integrity of walls and gates, but also a constant supply of new armaments, supplies and tools for repair. If one of these ingredients are missing, the structures become useless and the military corps are powerless to stop decay from setting in. After several years of hardship, what is seen in $STATENAME$ is this picture, a consequence of the disastrous bankruptcy that is crushing $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
