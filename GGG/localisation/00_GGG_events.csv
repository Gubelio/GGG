EVTNAME50000;The New Reactionary Regime;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC50000;The recent successful military action by reactionary cadres has caused the total overthrow of our nation’s government. Revolutionary guards organized by radicalized noblemen and clerical dissenters seized the major arteries of government in $CAPITAL$, causing most of the remaining legitimate government to flee or resign. The capital remains in a somber mood after the closure of frantic violence in the streets. Citing causes of tradition, legitimacy, the ancestral faith, and the divinely ordained order, they have rolled back political and social privileges dramatically. The parliament has been suspended, and rapidly a number of edicts restoring the old nobility and church to positions have been promulgated. This will be sure to cause domestic unrest, as well as has destabilized our position abroad as local governments attempt to regularize relations with the new regime. It remains to be seen how this will affect the development of our country long term. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT50000OPTA;Reaction is the order of the day, it seems.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME50001;The New Theocratist Regime;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC50001;The recent successful seizure of power by the theocratist paramilitary faction in $CAPITAL$ has affected a radical transformation of our state. After the brutal capture of the city, the theocratists forced a mass resignation of most officials, and performed a couple of particularly brutal religious killings of a number of non-compliant social activists and former governmental elites. They have rapidly set up a parallel bureaucracy as an outgrowth of their paramilitary faction’s political secretariat, and have quickly and violently enforced Theocratic control over much of the rest of the country though local gauleiter and collaborating clergy. Ultimately state power now rests in theory within the national theocratist synod, the collection of life-term clerics and internally elected party functionaries that head the political and military direction of the theocratist party. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT50001OPTA;I’ll see you at worship, then, fonctionnaire…;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME50002;The New Free-Yoker Regime;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC50002;The recent seizure of $CAPITAL$ by radical bands of 'Free-Yokers' has dramatically transformed the political constitution of our country. In their iconoclastic crusade against all symbols of privilege, aristocracy, and clericalism, they have routed the last government supporters that continued to fight and hung those which they could capture. Proclaiming the rights of the citizen-farmer and the “unfettered national spirit”, they have established a radical directorate committee to direct the “preservation of the national corps”, which has assumed most governmental powers for the time being. The central government in the meantime has passed a number of radical edicts, guaranteeing the privileges of the yeoman farmer as well as the rural laborer and the urban menu peuple, establishing labor regulation boards, grain distribution laws, encouraging anti-competitive and protective economic policies, and abolishing aristocratic privilege. Now it only remains to be seen how we can spread liberty beyond our borders…;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT50002OPTA;Hurrah for the popular will, I say!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME50003;The New Absolutist Regime;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC50003;The recent capture of our seat of government by the so-called $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Absolutist Army Faction has ushered in an age of new and shockingly different governments. Proclaiming the ‘age of the state’ begun, in the central square of $CAPITAL$, now rechristened ‘State Square’, the reconstruction of society began with the total abolition of identities beyond ‘citizen’, and it is clear that paramount leadership seems to lie in the bureaucratic secretariat or the military-political commissariate. Most state offices have either been awarded by appointment by the party leadership, or have been abolished and reshaped. Much private land has been seized as “wastage” for alternative usage, and a number of “inefficiencies, abuses, and crimes” have been abolished. It seems that in the foreseeable future our country will be under the strict and punctual leadership of a swarm of party functionaries, teachers, shop-floor managers and agricultural overseers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT50003OPTA;Why, good chap, I believe that’s quorum!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME50004;The Age of the State;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC50004;Recently, a certain group of new political theorists in $COUNTRY$, stimulated, they say, by a reflection upon the perennial disorders of war, industrial recession, famine, inefficiency, have diagnosed the source of society's ills as not one of inequality or political radicalism, but one of 'anarchy'. Growing out of social liberationist speculation, they have arrived at the conclusion that despite the correct impulses of liberationism, the current state cannot correctly support its intentions. Claiming the current state is ill suited to deal with modern material civilization - the various industrial innovations that have reshaped the economic and attendant social order of the day - they propose a radical reorganization of the state along the lines of the most efficient industrial and corporate enterprises. Endorsing all reforms to rid the state of inefficiency, by means centralized planning, a needed expression of state bureaucracy, rationalization of legislation, elimination of autonomy, etc, the 'statist' ideology demands that the state itself be rationalized to save the gains of social libertarianism from the new ills of inefficiency and the vagaries of the market.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT50004OPTA;Fascinating;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME50005;The Doctrine of Absolutism;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC50005;Ever since the increased agitation of statist reforms and political organization, a new, more virulent and extreme form of statism has emerged from a circle of intellectuals in $COUNTRY$ out of frustration with the statist impulse to compromise with and even protect Liberationist reforms. Turning their back on statism's roots as a means for the preservation of social Liberationism, they have come to suggest that the state itself is an 'absolute' good, an entity that serves no greater good than itself. They cry that the efficiency and capacity of the state must be enforced and pursued 'absolutely', with total indifference to petty squabbling and selfish demands of its constituents. This, they claim, will ultimately, and exclusively, bring true prosperity to those members of the state, unlike the illusions of other ideologies which bring only selfish gain to certain members of the state. Ultimately the absolutist impulse is a radical reformulation and indeed clarification of the purpose and even very being of the state: the state should be seen as an enterprise that succeeds or fails in the preservation and expansion of its own power, capacity, and efficiency, and nothing else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT50005OPTA;How peculiar;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME50006;The First Theocratist Synod;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC50006;The principles of conservatism and reaction have long languished in the doldrums of opposition and desperate compromise. Now, however, we are seeing the revival of the forces of reaction. The 'theocratist' speculators of $COUNTRY$ make radical claims: everywhere, fat and useless bureaucracies deliver grains to idle vagrants and wastrels who have been uprooted from their ancestral homes, great slum tenements have risen up in our once bright cities, the humble farmer is ruined by the slump in the prices of commodities, and mankind wallows, spiritually blighted by this atheistic age of worldly delights. And so a voice hearkens for the halcyon days of yore, when each man knew his station and worked the land of a fatherly lord. A day when each man did not indulge in strange, synthetic compounds, or interpret scriptures in his own degenerate way, but listened to the strictures of the educated priest. But how to achieve this, in such an age of markets and factories? The theocratist ideology claims that the authoritarian and centralizing implements of the modern state pioneered by statism must be employed in fact explicitly for the sake of moral edification and social order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT50006OPTA;Interesting;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME50007;A Country Mobilized;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC50007;Conscripts are being drafted left and right and the poor are being trained and prepared to fight. Military camps are full of fresh recruits, troops are carrying out exercises in our borders and every aspect of society and every signal the government gives seems to indicate a war is in progress, yet there's no war. This large disruption in the country's daily life is angering our population and making our neighbours increasingly wary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT50007OPTA;These are just harmless exercises.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME50008;A Theocratic Government;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC50008;Recent reforms in our state have dramatically elevated the significance and constitutional role of a number of religious authorities and bodies. This preponderant influence of the clergy and faith institutions in decision making, legislation, and judgment means our state most properly ought to be described as a 'theocracy' above anything else. Gradually, through the influence of the courts and religious police, much of the nominally “secular” government has become beholden to religious authorities, and has melded into one structure. Religious discourse dominates the public sphere, and there is at this point very few who would not publicly profess the state faith. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT50008OPTA;Glory be, and all that, yes, yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME50009;The Rise of a Prince;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC50009;Recent reforms in our country have graduated centralized power around a single authoritarian personage of an aristocratic dynasty, suggesting that at this point it is probably appropriate to call our country a “princely despotate”, as per the common parlance. This creeping shift has occurred as the executive has gradually gained power by the slow removal of special ecclesiastical dominion, as well as centralized the bureaucracy in the hands of loyalist bourgeois officeholders. The effective decline of aristocratic power in active governance has weakened the parliament with the rise of the power of the prince. Local magnates and squires in the countryside are bewailing a decline in “natural liberties” and “the old constitution and our beloved commonwealth”, and clerics are warning of a “new secularism”, but it seems most subjects have quiescently accepted the augmented power of our monarch, who increasingly formalizes their power by the day, as the royal court grows more sure of itself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT50009OPTA;Well, at least it will cut down on squabbling...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME50010;The New Constitution;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC50010;Our state has recently undergone a number of critical political changes related to political decentralization, corporate legislation, and aristocratic privilege, such that we might at this point call our country an “aristocratic commonwealth”. Power lies now first and foremost amongst a body of great noble proprietors collaborating in a parliamentary body. The gradual devolution of both the regional executive and judicial powers to local aristocratic magnates has enabled the graduate capture of the country by these great barons and marcher lords. While this generally bodes poorly for the serf and whatever remnants of an executive remain, most burghers and yeomen have silently accepted the changes, integrating themselves into the increasingly aristocratic structures through town charters and elective corporations. It is not long, surely, before the executive is neigh more than a figurehead, and the church is all but private property of the local lord, some are saying. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT50010OPTA;Two, or six hundred, heads, are better than one?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME50011;The Abolition of Serfdom;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC50011;Our state laws are explicit on the illegality of any sort of arrangements of serfrom or land-bondage. The strict enforcement of these is the business of our censors, tax collectors and assessors, and regional government officials, who work to extend this legislation into all the reaches of our great territory in order to abolish this archaic practice wherever it may be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT50011OPTA;Well, that will make these folk jolly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME50012;The Abolition of Thralldom;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC50012;Our state laws explicitly forbid the rearing, culling, vending, driving, booleying, pasturing, breeding, and above all consuming the flesh of hominid cattle, or 'thralls'. Commonly the preserve of ranchers and herdsmen in the desolate reaches or barbarous uplands of our society, the abolition and enforcement of this policy is usually the purview of regional sheriffs and the mounted gendarme, who work tirelessly to eradicate the practice wherever they may find it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT50012OPTA;Social progress, they call it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME50014;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Congress;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC50014;EVTDESC11100;A rising tide of nationalism within greater $CULTURE_GROUP_UNION$ has toppled the government in $FROMCOUNTRY$. A congress of nationalistic revolutionaries has been convened, with representatives from all of $CULTURE_GROUP_UNION$, which has decreed that the time is right for the nation to unite under one banner. The congress has offered the crown of this united $CULTURE_GROUP_UNION$ to us. We could accept the offer, but doing so would cause international alarm, and require us to compensate the revolutionaries politically.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This is more than a political campaign, it is a call to arms...\n\nA spokesperson of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government was quoted saying as the matter of the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ debt exploded in the press. They went bankrupt again, defying previous treaties and now there's talk of military intervention to make sure we will get paid.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The lesson should be constantly enforced that though the people support the Government, the Government should not support the people."\n\nAs the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ defaults on their debts, the civil servants and the economy are suffering greatly from austerity measures. They owed us some money when they defaulted but since the amount is small, we wouldn't normally take any action. We can choose to act, but not forgiving such a small debt will get some worried and angry reactions from the Great Powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC50020;A half abandoned leviathan stuck in the coast. That is how locals in $PROVINCENAME$ describe the decrepit facilities of the old naval base that used to be a local asset strategically important for the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government. In truth, the naval base has been in decline for a long while and the government defaulting is just the rock bottom.

EVTDESC50022;If one in $YEAR$ were to look at the state of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ line of defences in $PROVINCENAME$, what they would see is a multitude of abandoned bases and unmanned fortifications occupied only by squatters. A fortification is something tricky to maintain - not only it needs regular assessment of the integrity of walls and gates, but also a constant supply of new armaments, supplies and tools for repair. If one of these ingredients are missing, the structures become useless and the military corps are powerless to stop decay from setting in. After several years of hardship, what is seen in $STATENAME$ is this picture, a consequence of the disastrous bankruptcy that is crushing $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME50023;Ancestral Swamp Farming;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC50023;Our civilisation is a truly ancient one - for millennia our people have worked on the vast paddies and swamplands that constitute the great Poudwouvas river valley. Thousands of years of careful earthworks, dredging, canal construction, and bank reinforcement have turned our great mangroves and swamplands into carefully cultivated fertile paddies for the harvest of riverseed and Pruub flower. Huge mud and root embankments of dense, drooping mangroves line the cuts and gullies to protect from excessive flooding, and provide channels for the barges and gondolas to gently pass through. The houses of our people lie on elegant stilts, or their mud dwellings rest safely atop vast stones moved centuries ago in forgotten engineering feats. When his majesty the Vopodwou, the celestial emperor, the very lynchpin of the world, looks upon his vast domain in the morning, when the rays of the sun kiss the paddies, he can be sure that his civilisation will be bountiful and enduring for the unending future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME50024;A Peculiar Request;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC50024;The foreign secretary maintains, out of necessity, congress with the leading figures of industrial and imperial circles: elegant soirees hosted for the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Settlement Society, lavish dinners with industrialists, and hundreds of subtle conversations in private dwellings. Now, however, we are informed of a most peculiar request. An adventurous sort of man, an ex-lieutenant, a self-styled explorer who’s spent time in the far east among the locals, who came into a private fortune by either smuggling, trading, or inheritance (the matter remains murky), has seemingly drummed up a lot of enthusiasm about leading a small band of reservists, thugs, and other martial men to take over some godforsaken chiefdom or other in the wild beyond, with which he seems to be somehow sordidly personally entangled, due to his travels. Most pertinently, he’s passed a request to the foreign secretary actually asking for ships and means to achieve this, promising to incorporate these lands into our state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT50024OPTA;Who is this fool? Get him out of here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME50025;The Filibuster Succeeds!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC50025;About fourteen months ago, our foreign office and exchequer, for better or for worse, provided a soldier of fortune with means to make himself master of a small undeveloped region beyond our shores. His unkempt soldiers shuffled into their vessels in an unspectacular way, and with little fanfare left our wharfs for distant shores, to scant notice outside of certain circles. Staggeringly, however, we have just received a formal communique from this man who informs us that he and his men have mastered this distant land, and established a small colonial government. He wishes to hand over a government of ‘protectorate’ to the colonial office, in exchange only for a number of handsome concessions on commercial prospects and trading regions, and large parcels of land for himself and his soldiers, as well as a small lifelong stipend from the state. It’s better to have such an ambitious man overseas, anyhow, says the minister of the interior.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT50025OPTA;Hoorah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME50026;The Filibuster Fails!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC50026;It has now been over fourteen months since we last heard from this adventurer. Rumor has it that he and his men were eaten alive by beast-men in Shobgizob, or vanquished in battle in some cursed desert in Bafozh, or simply destroyed by a great ocean storm before they had even stepped foot on foreign lands. Regardless, it is safe to assume that this adventurer and his men are long dead, our money wasted, and our officials made to look foolish for ever trusting this soldier of fortune.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT50026OPTA;Never again will I trust another fool with an expensive dream!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME50027;The Treacherous Adventurer;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC50027;About fourteen months ago, someone, surely sacked now, in the government made the dubious call to provide a roguish and dashing fellow with the substantial means to master a small overseas region for our own colonial aggrandizement. Now, however, we are receiving reports that while this chap did manage to make himself master of this region, he has been decidedly silent in communicating with our government, and is actually styling himself as a local king after intermarrying with local nobility! Him and his thugs have made themselves the effective elites of the region, and have even had the gall to begin encouraging settlements from our mainland! While he has managed to extend the norms of our government across the region, all in all it is a huge embarrassment for the foreign office to have this little tyrant renege on his promises to hand over governance and to continue to live as a prince on our dime!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC50028;The colonial frontier is always a flexible thing - indeed, all frontiers and borderlands are.

However, sometimes these territories can ignite into great conflagrations of tension. This is what happened recently at one of our colonial borders - it’s not exactly clear what has happened, but it appears some movement of settlers has provoked a raid of a sort that ended in masacre. Local gazetteers are crying out for blood, and settler violence has already flared up in an alarming way.

EVTNAME50030;The Raid on the Mountain;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC50030;The progressive sophistication of the state, theories of negotiation with the primitive mind, and increasing access to inhospitable regions due to modern technology has created a great amount of tension over the barren Sithit desert. This largely inhospitable empty region is mainly dominated by Sithit wastlanders and their thralls, vewugist mullahs, and strange desert fauna. Nonetheless, the potential security issues with another power controlling it has brought this issue to the forefront of political debate on our frontier. Happily, however, it seems the situation has resolved itself! The Gashdzii marcher lords of the western reaches have staged what is already being called ‘Gibbalobba’s Raid on the Mountain’: a wild band of Gashdzii soldiers of fortune made their way deep into the center of the desert to the great lone mountain, stormed the primitive Sithit fortress city, and declared themselves Lords. However, facing native resistance, they are seeking state reinforcements to guarantee their power…;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC50031;The Dheduhd region to our north has long been the purview of slavers, political exiles, and religious extremists. While nominally within our 'borders', populated by tribesmen and itinerant bedouins, this region has long been pointless to control besides by mild tributary means and soft religious authority. However, recent innovations in population management and transportation technology has led to the encroachments upon desert regions around the world, and our interior ministry is concerned about security issues in this region should it fall into the hands of foreign powers. They advise the establishment of a frontier garrison to enforce an effective occupation of this region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC50033;The long stretch of coast below the temperate forests of the northern valley has for centuries been borderline impossible to inhabit, let alone govern, by all but the most hardy bedouins and their itinerant councils. Hemmed in by mountains, and a calm, shallow sea, these are some of the driest places on the planet. However, as transportation technology improves, military force advances, and government bureaucracy expands, the management of populations and regions like this becomes more and more feasible. Our predominant influence in the posts on the edge of the desert and dominance of the adjacent sea gives us a decided advantage already in projecting influence. Our interior ministry suggests establishing a number of coastal fortifications and naval outposts in the bays our sailors already frequent, and extending the frontier garrisons into the few oases of the interior. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;

More galling, even, is that they have elevated some Pruuntish paganism to their new state cult! This act is a blatant challenge to both his majesty's honor and to the legitimacy of our regime.

In fact, a number of our provinces have suddenly become new hot spots for this activity! Whether stumbled across by a hapless mining firm trying to break new land in carbon rich soils, or by a local eccentric plumbing the land, one can see the pumps going up and the barrels slowly beginning to trickle back to our metropolitan hubs for refinement and processing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC50038;Gums and natural elastics have always been a useful and curious commodity. However, since the discovery of how to process natural latex and extract it from the rubber tree, there has been a great proliferation of industrial ventures towards the cultivation of this useful substance. A number of provinces in our territory have recently undergone a number of changes in production related to these development: explorers and hired mercenaries have generally invaded and graduated co-opted local populations through violence, coercion, and opportunity, to the erection of large rubber tree plantations, the effective development of which we are now seeing. Huge monoculture forests now sprawl over rolling hills, and the little whitewashed cabins of the overseers hold papers and men direct the latex down the forested paths back to our cities to processed into a thousands forms, as tyres, sealants, clothing, chemical implements, and more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME50040;A Question of Sovereignty;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC50040;For a long time we have had paramount influence in a certain primitive nation. Our consuls maintain separate jurisdictions, the legation quarter has its own civilian and military authorities, and our large companies have exclusive monopolies over major commodities and trading districts. Our currency has rapidly taken on the role of a parallel object of exchange, and for all intents and purposes $FROMCOUNTRY$ is a subordinate part of our imperial system. However, with recent changes in the global political arena, there seems to be an annexationist fever amongst rival powers. Swathes of territory are being picked off left and right, and our merchants and missionaries are increasingly worried about $FROMCOUNTRY$ falling into foreign hands. The foreign ministry is currently drafting a proposal to proclaim protectorate over these lands and remove civilian and military authority totally into our hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT50040OPTA;It is time for them to accept their new masters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT50040OPTB;At this moment we cannot, but perhaps in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME50041;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC50041;Our country has recently fallen under the tutelage of a great power. Their functionaries, missionaries, and merchants swarm over our land. Very few citizens have gone unexposed to the tendrils of their power, and much of the civilian government has fallen under their influence. Recently, however, things have taken an alarming turn. Their consul has made a number of proposals about placing us under protectorate, and ‘reorganization’ of our army, financial structure, and proposing new judicial districts for our own courts. This would effectively annihilate any remaining scraps of independence we may have. This is a crucial time for our nation and we must be very careful if we are ready to resist this great power to save our homeland from foreign domination.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT50041OPTA;With great sadness I will lay my crown upon the dirt;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT50041OPTB;The streets of $CAPITAL$ will run red with $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ blood!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME50042;$FROMCOUNTRY$ refuses to become a protectorate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC50042;The foreign minister reports, to great frustration, and shock that $FROMCOUNTRY$ has expelled our consulate and laid siege to our legation district! It appears they are attempting to resist our generous offer of protectorate and are now attempting to drive all our influence from the country. Local expatriate gazettes are reporting shock and horror, as missionaries are massacred, traders are hung up on gallows, and gentle folk are being stabbed in the streets by fanatical madmen! The situation has become decidedly out of our control, and the military is in a position to step in to put these regrettable upstarts in their place, and establish control of this valuable region with which for so long we have had happy and peaceful interests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT50042OPTA;Then we shall force them into submission with musket and ball!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT50042OPTB;Well... let's not do anything too drastic;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME50044;Defeated by Poumnia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC50044;Our recent defeat by the armies of Poumnia has left a tragic state of affairs in our country. Their savage soldiers have destroyed and sacked our capital, and they have killed not only most of our ministers, but any of the nationalistic elite in a particularly brutal series of beheadings. Any signs of Shamushi worship have been violently stamped out in their long and horrific punitive occupation, and a new collaborationist, decidedly pro-imperial elite has been installed as the new regent class. This marks an age of increased Poumnian influence in our lands, and one can feel it will be many years before the stirrings of Pruuntish identity can begin to organize themselves again after this shattering event. This war will live in infamy in the annals of Pruuntish history.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT50044OPTA;We will lick our wounds...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME50045;Claim the Island of Ghurv?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC50045;This is another age of exploration: new steamships issue forward from our ports that allow our sailors to travel further, faster, and safer. Vast oceans cover the majority of our vast planet, and huge prohibitive storms have historically encouraged traders and explorers to cling to the coasts. Now, however, as ever-more liners cross distant seas, we are making a number of unexpected discoveries. Small islands reported by wrecked merchant men in the distant far east, which have appeared and disappeared from our maps for the past couple hundred years are becoming definitively known. In recent months, a small vessel of ours came across a small unclaimed set of islands, and the captain of which, after a small ceremony exchanging honors and meals with the locals, decided to claim the island in our name! It is up to us if we would like to accept these new lands into our patrimony - a new coaling station or trading outpost is attractive, but we would of course have to staff an administration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT50045OPTA;Plant the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ flag!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT50045OPTB;Bah, why would we want a patch of lifeless sand in the sea?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME50046;Claim the Island of Taafraavsk?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME50047;Claim the Island of Mress?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME50048;Claim the Island of Njinye?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC50055;It has been long since $PROVINCENAME$ was added to our mighty domain. Many of our people now reside here and call $PROVINCENAME$ home. Both domestically and internationally $PROVINCENAME$ is referred to as an integral part of $PROVINCENAME$, without scrutiny or debate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
