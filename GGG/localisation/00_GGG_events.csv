EVTNAME50004;The Statist Proclamation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC50004;Political theory in recent years has taken a sharp turn away from historical speculation and debations between Liberationists and Conservatives. Stimulated, they say, by a reflection upon the perennial disorders of war, industrial recession, famine, inefficiency, a certain group of political theorists in $COUNTRY$ have diagnosed the source of society's ills as not one of inequality or political radicalism, but one of 'anarchy'. Growing out of social liberationist speculation, they have arrived at the conclusion that despite the correct impulses of liberationism, the current state cannot correctly support its intentions. Claiming the current state is ill suited to deal with modern material civilization - the various industrial innovations that have reshaped the economic and attendant social order of the day - they propose a radical reorganization of the state along the lines of the most efficient industrial and corporate enterprises. Endorsing all reforms to rid the state of inefficiency, by means centralized planning, a needed expression of state bureaucracy, rationalization of legislation, elimination of autonomy, etc, the 'statist' - as they call themselves - ideology demands that the state itself be rationalized to save the gains of social libertarianism from the new ills of inefficiency and the vagaries of the market.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME50005;The Age of the State;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC50005;Ever since the increased agitation of statist reforms and political organization, a new, more virulent and extreme form of statism has emerged from a circle of intellectuals in $COUNTRY$ out of frustration with the statist impulse to compromise with and even protect Liberationist reforms that, the advocates of this new philosophy say, preserve inefficiency. Turning their back on statismâ€™s roots as a means for the preservation of social liberationism, they have come to suggest that the state itself is an 'absolute' good, an entity that serves no greater good than itself, and that its members must ultimately be subordinated to it. They cry that the efficiency and capacity of the state must be enforced and pursued 'absolutely', with total indifference to petty squabbling and selfish demands of its constituents. This, they claim, will ultimately, and exclusively, bring true prosperity to those members of the state, unlike the illusions and promises of other ideologies which bring only selfish gain to certain members of the state. Ultimately the absolutist impulse is a radical reformulation and indeed clarification of the purpose and even very being of the state - the state should be seen as an enterprise that succeeds or fails in the preservation and expansion of its own power, capacity, and efficiency, and nothing else - as an entity that lives, breathes, and grows for its own sake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME50006;The Doctrine of Theocratism;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC50006;The principles of conservatism and reaction have long languished in the doldrums of opposition and desperate compromise. In most of the economically progressive regions of the world, traditional society has retreated in melancholy step to the sturdy wind of of liberationism or statism, and in those places where it has preserved in seems to preserve in name only, with most aristocratic states and princely despotates having surrendered to the reforming ideologies substantially in form and practice. Now, however, we are seeing the stirrings of a more vigorous than ever, deeper and more fundamental, reaction to the changes society has undergone. Everywhere one finds the common man confused and dazed by the modern world - fat and useless bureaucracies deliver grains to idle vagrants and wastrels who have been uprooted from their ancestral homes, great slum tenements have risen up in our once bright cities, the humble farmer is ruined by the slump in the prices of commodities, and mankind wallows, spiritually blighted by this atheistic age of worldly delights and the sordid pastimes of a rootless, hectic, and schizophrenic market. And so a voice hearkens for the halcyon days of yore, when each man knew his station, and did not toil in a black slavery of the factories, but worked the land of a fatherly lord. A day when each man did not curse his ancestral gods, and indulge in strange, synthetic compounds, or interpret scriptures in his own degenerate way, but listened to the structures of the educated priest, and was assured a place in a more wholesome spiritual order. But how to achieve this, in such an age of markets and factories? The 'theocratist' speculators of $COUNTRY$ claim they have the answer. By employing the means of statist control, we can turn back this degenerate tide of social 'progress', which has led man into the most hopeless waste and dark dens of immorality, and bring social order back to the one of our ancient forefathers. The theocratic ideology claims that the explicit goal of the modern state must be for the sake of moral edification and social order, and ultimately identifies the traditional lifestyle as the correct one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
