stack_upper_house_liberationist_desc;In recent months our executive agenda has been entirely stymied by the uncooperative legislature of our government, and the ruling party is unable to govern freely, and remake the nation in its image. After many contentious negotiations, it seems constitutionally possible that we could stack the upper house and create enough members such that we could force our own legislative agenda through the executive. However, this would be sure to cause massive political uproar. For while this isn’t strictly unconstitutional, it goes against the spirit of our laws, and all accepted political tradition. Those endorsing opposing ideologies are sure to be enraged, and we are sure to suffer some international humiliation as well for our untamed legislature. This would have to be carefully done, but it will allow us, on the other hand, to pass most reforms the current government feels are desperately needed for the health of the nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

form_kiidnazh_title;Form Kiidnazh;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
form_kiidnazh_desc;The 'Kiidnazh', the 'thousand-realms' was ostensibly the greatest and most dynamic state in history until it’s shattering around three hundred years ago. Encompassing at its height around 50 million subjects, the domain and law of the emperor carried from the northern reaches to the southern jungles. An integrated political entity for nearly a millennium, the empire rose up from humble beginnings on the central plateaus of Ishahfazh, centered eventually around the imperial city and legendary urban settlement of Pashdzii. Its great weight and imperium carried Gashdzii culture, language, commerce, and peoples across the reaches of the south of Ishafazh, in the long term assimilating or replacing most of the native identities. However, centuries of increasingly corrupt, incompetent, or distracted leadership and spiraling devolution of power into local “Jadhov”s [“Greatlords” - Provincial governors and military commanders] led to a slow and painful decoupling of the bonds of empire. Riven by civil wars, puppet emperors, rebellious provinces, imperial pretenders, the “age of undoing” shattered the empire, and it is widely reckoned that Bosha^da^zzi IV, so-called “the sorrowful”, was the last true emperor of the lineage of Godhiinimiz the first and the great, despite the long and continued presence of a nominal imperial personage in Pashdzii. Now, however, things are changing - our state, to the exclusion of others, for the first time in centuries, holds paramount influence across the old imperial lands. Our rivals lay defeated and submissive or totally conquered. Truly, one trembles to think of this historic moment - across these lands, millions upon millions of souls now look to our state for lawgiving, direction, and hegemony. This is the age of the new empire, and it is the day that the Kiidnazh is reforged from the strewn ruins of greed and strife. In a grand ceremony in Pashdzii, where throning hoards from thousands of miles and millions of homes crowded the streets, today the empire was proclaimed reunited and a constitution was ratified to formally incorporate all our disparate lands under one banner and one sovereign identity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

form_the_great_nag_title;Form the Great Nâg;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
form_the_great_nag_desc;The political traditions of the south Gashdzii have long been different from our northern neighbors. Much of these lands were settled not during the feudal-aristocratic days of early-high empire, but in the later sturdy years when wagons of settlers went south and east to found small communities of free yeomen and cities of merchant traders. The nominal marcher lords were quick to compromise, and adapt to their advantage, these robust free communities. Forming small confederations of barons and free men-at-arms, the baronial elite were able to maintain profitable plantations worked by landless labor, and the urban conglomerates were able to derive some protection from pressing demands of northern taxes. A gradual tendency to enclosure and plantation stimulated migration to the cities, and a gentle equilibrium of political moderatism and commonwealth emerged. This political tradition, identifiable in the “na^g” or commonwealth, lasted through the shattering of the empire, and has been strengthened by a religious-cultural identity shaped by Motkohnism, the ethico-judical fatalistic faith of the south. Now, indeed, the paramount influence of our state in the southern regions, but not the proper political integration of which, has led to a number of cries for equal representation and the formation of a great southern political confederation. Our ministry has drafted a broad constitution and delegates from across these lands have gathered in $CAPITAL$ to ratify the birth of this new state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
restore_house_athis_title;Restore House Athis!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
restore_house_athis_desc;The House of Athis is one of the oldest in Siethevan history, tracing its lineage far back into the prehistory of our Siethevan warbands that struggled against the dour Poumnians and the savage Ghech. The formal branch of Athis ascended the throne over six hundred years ago, and governed a kingdom of the Siethevans with the blessing of the Sublime Vewug undisturbed for centuries. Now, however, the heir to his holy legacy languishes in the court of the Vokonazhi, deprived of his birthright. But why is this? Who would overturn a government ordained by the master of the mondrial plane? Driven from his ancestral home, his family butchered, the house of Athis was overthrown in the year 1297 by the fanatical hoards of Free-Yoker madmen who seized the capital and established their preposterous heretical regime of the ‘Sublime Veyethu’! But now we are in a position to right these wrongs… having reunified the lands of the Sitheve under our hegemony, our government has invited the scion of house Athis to return from his ignominious exile, and to retake the mantle of government and don once more the Crown of the Chyush! Hurrah for the Siethevan People! Hurrah for House Athis! Hurrah for the will of the Mighty Vewug!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
embrace_shamush_title;Embrace Shamush;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
embrace_shamush_desc;We peoples of Pruuntia have long languished in the shadow of the Poumnian empire. Our tongue is not far off from the Poumnians of the north, and indeed our kings, temples, and small principalities have long been considered tributary parts of their great celestial empire. But we are a different sort of folk than they. We are seafarers and fishermen, where they are a staid, agricultural people. We are joyous and free, where they are dour slaves of the empire. And for centuries our people have kept our own traditions and folkways around the ‘Shamush’ way, the awareness of the bicephalous serpentine spirits that knit the very world together, despite the presence of the imperial cult among our elites. But in recent years, more and more of our poets, our writers, even local princes themselves speak of Shamush lore, and above all what that means for one who would call themselves a Pruunt. For too long, cries on impassioned writer, we have languished under the cultural, political, and religious tyranny of the government of the Vopudwou. We should have our our faith, our own state, our own destiny, as the Pruuntish people! Proud, noble seafarers! It is we who first journeyed to Kovazh, many centuries ago. It is we who hunt the great bloated molluscs of the Diwvo depths, and trawl the thronging shoals of the western oceans. We are not Poumnians, we are Pruuntish people, and we follow the Shamush way! The government, it is said, should close the imperial temples, stop sending offerings to the capital, and above all, they should call the emperor not a god but a despot, if they wish to be a Pruuntish government. It is time we heard this call. To challenge the Poumnian empire like this would surely lead to a swift and terrible reaction from their large army - the empire has never been challenged in such away in recorded memory, and the cult of the Divine Vopudwou is the very foundation of their statehood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
form_pruuntawrish_title;Form Pruuntawrish;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
form_pruuntawrish_desc;There has never been in history a unified Pruuntish state. Long fractured amongst rival sea-lords, small ecclesiastical dominions, petty merchant republics, and above all tyrannized by the Poumnians to the north, our lands now lay for the first time in history unified, sovereign, and unbowed. It is we who challenged the Poumnian ‘elder brother’ and locked horns with the imperialist cause. Today, then, we proclaim the Pruuntawrish - the Pruuntish state. In a grand ceremony in $CAPITAL$, attended by the scions of the old naval houses, the merchant families, the Shamush teacher-priest dynasties, and above all the cheering populace, the minister of state proclaimed the formal adoption of this new name and the promulgation of a unified government for Pruunts everywhere. There will be many challenges ahead as we strive to fend for ourselves in the international political arena, but today is truly a momentous, perhaps the most momentous, day in Pruuntish history.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
annex_dhuknag_title;Bring Dhuknâg into the Fold;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
annex_dhuknag_desc;The diminutive region known as 'Dhuknâg' has always had a difficult and tenuous existence. On the borders between the Gashdzii empire and ancient Poumnia, this flexible borderland has developed a flimsy identity around its frontier status and consequent tradition of moderate autonomy. However, now that we are a major regional power, a number of bureaucrats of the foreign office have made the curious suggestion that this region needs to be annexed for security reasons. Long an unsure part of both Poumnia and the Gashdzii empire, they believe we could easily trump up a story of ‘effective administration’ and a ‘supervised district’ despite the strong governance of the region as it is. If done swiftly, this region may be an important asset for our security in continental and regional politics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
embrace_shamush_peaceful_title;Embrace Shamush;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
embrace_shamush_peaceful_desc;Recent changes in the government of Poumnia have forced us to reflect on the religious constitution of our country. The dramatic overthrow of the Vopudwou, their celestial empire who is worshiped as a god, not only in their kingdom but all around the circle sea, into our Pruuntish lands, has shaken the very foundation of the world. We have many temples to the emperor, and most of our elites belong to the imperial cult, sending small offerings across the sea yearly to pray to his majesty. But now it seems we are at a loss for what to do - his majesty, it seems, is not God, but man. His kingdom fell and the rivers continued to run, and the sun continued to rise. In Poumnia many of their temples have been converted to messianic cults of a transcendent, unconquered and reborn world-spirit-emperor, but we in Pruuntia have our own indigenous faith, that of the ‘Shamush’ way. These esoteric folkways have been preserved by itinerant preachers, secretive religious schools, and village rites. Above all Shamush is almost less a faith, but a ‘way of seeing’. It might be prudent to dissociate our government from the dying empire, and publicly endorse Shamush rites for the first time in recorded memory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
the_ghan_gheecha_idea_title;The Ghan-Gheecha Idea;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
the_ghan_gheecha_idea_desc;We Byotrish have always been foreign to our neighbors. Tall, strong, and fast, we are not like those stout little fellows who came to live in the river and on the plateau and eastern plains. For indeed it was we who lived there long before those plateau men came with their boars from the east. The poets and bards sing of times of yore when we used to range across the vast plains, heroic warriors with sturdy frames, able to fight five of the stout and low men with ease. Now, though, it is not like this. Driven into the mountains, we live a complacent and impoverished life on the margins of civilization, while our racial brothers, our fellow Ghechan people, toil on the fields of the stout men in Poumnia and Gashdziik. How long must this state of affairs persist, lament our authors, our leaders, and indeed all those who have seen the suffering of the slaves of the lowlands? Shall we be blind to our fate? Nay! In recent years not only has our confederation gained material strength, political order, but the spirit of our people have been stirred to a new national consciousness of our racial destiny to right the wrongs of a 1000 years and liberate our brothers! This is the "the Ghan-Gheecha idea" - the unabashed birthright of the Ghechi, whether Byotrin, Anuvo, or Shagmodt!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
liberate_the_anuvo_title;Liberate the Anuvo;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
liberate_the_anuvo_desc;The Byotrish of the Poudwouvas have toiled for so many centuries in slavery not only do most of them speak a wretched Poumnian patois tongue, but they happily call themselves ‘Anuvo’, the slur for us that the Poumnian brutes speak bitterly. Nonetheless, they are our racial brethren, and we have a historic responsibility to free them from their suffering. For it was the Poumnians above all who were most cruel to our people - it was they who were not content just to drive us from our lands, but continued to stage slave raids into our lands for centuries. To recover even a fraction of these lands would bring unending glory to our forces. It is time to right the sins of history with blood!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
liberate_the_shagmodt_title;Liberate the Shagmodt;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
liberate_the_shagmodt_desc;The Byotrish of the plains have toiled for so many centuries in slavery not only do most of them speak a wretched Gashdzii patois tongue, but they have become alarmingly attached to the several heathen and idolatrous faiths of the intellectually backwards Gashdzii, doubtless an abomination in the eyes of the Great Vewug. The faster this situation is remedied, the better. We must retake the nearest lands stolen from us long ago, and let our warrior range free over the planes of the east once again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
liberate_the_west_ghechi_title;Liberate the West Ghechi;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
liberate_the_west_ghechi_desc;The west Ghech territories have long lain under the yoke of the Sithevan peoples. Politically driven from these lands long ago, some of our people still scrape by in a meager living along these plains and on the banks of the great lake. While effectively governed by the Sithevans, we surely can make an irredentist claim to these lands. These long fallen territories must be recovered too!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

conquest_kovazhi_desert_desc;For all of known history the great empty white sands of the Bauxae have remained a wild and dangerous place. To our northern border towns and cities it is known for harboring bandits and Biori raiders who for centuries have made forays into our land to loot homes, pillage temples, and capture children to be made into thralls, but now after a series of centralization and modernization projects our government now finally has the means to do something about this hazardous wasteland. Our generals tell us it would take one swift military operation to occupy the desert, subdue the Biori tribesmen, and finally bring peace to the northlands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
centralize_the_empire_title;Abolish the Prayerlands;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
centralize_the_empire_desc;The crown of the Qooxib has long put aside vast lands for relentless contemplation and worship of the silent god. Only through perfect ritual purity can His sublime and exacting will be pleased, and the world be a perfect mirror of this sacrosanct will. The slender prayer towers of these monastic reservations stand tall and imperiously over rolling valleys, in which only are heard the endless reminiscent bells tolling to drown the words and thoughts of men, and these lands are bounded by the little old stones that every Qooxiban knows to cross unpurified means to offend God. For many hundreds of years the state has encouraged the maintenance of these monastic domains within the patrimony of empire, considering it a pious policy to safeguard the worshiplands. Now, however, it is a new age. The first rolling automotives imported from Ishahfazh have thundered through our lands, the mechanical presses churn out constant gazettes and pamphlets, and towers belching soot and ash now rise beside their older kin which housed men - everyone agrees that life has gotten faster, dirtier, and chattier. The prayer lands, say the writers and the modernisers, are thus an anachronism. The tenants toll under the tyranny of zealot monks living in a different century, and the boundary stones block the swift movement of worldly goods. Extreme brutality and all sorts of evils persist - slavery, gougings for impurities, draconian legal dues, and worse. The modern state must do away with these abuses and abolish the prayerlands for the sake of good governance - we must please the silent god, all of us, in our own lives, and not trust distant monks to do it for us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

torching_of_the_great_drupe_title;Raze the Great Drupe;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
torching_of_the_great_drupe_desc;The 'Great Drupe' is a site of immense importance to the Vewugi faith. It is a sprawling ancient palace with seemingly endless labyrinthine hallways and rooms inhabited by hundreds of Vewugi holy men. Inside, it is reported that residing within this palace is the Great Vewug himself, an immensely powerful spirit or deity which the Vewugis worship. The Vewug is said to appear before certain holy men at certain times within the palace, and the Vewug's every movement or word spoken is to be recorded and later deliberated on and interpreted. Perhaps it comes from collective delusion or the use of the hallucinogenic Nuzhdap - these fanatics are certain that this being exists within these very walls. But now that we have occupied the surrounding landscape, many high-ranking military men have floated the idea of razing this palace once and for all. This will surely be a devastating blow to our enemy and to the entirety of the Vewugist faith, but it will most certainly enrage Vewugists across the world and drive them to violence against us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

annex_deuuyeuru_desc;For centuries, Poumnian sailors and soldiers have stopped along the shores of Deuuyeuru to trade and resupply. Some of these Poumnians married Pruuntish women and settled in the capital city of Aaykeum. Many of these expatriates rose to become some of the most important and affluent citizens of Deuuyeuru and have proved invaluable in asserting Poumnian influence over the island. In recent years, however, with the rise of Pruuntish nationalism and Shamushi snake-worship, tensions in Aaykeum have become shockingly high, with several assassinations of prominent Poumnians. Many of these expatriates fear they will soon be forced to flee the island or face violence at the hands of radicals. However, officials in our government think we could use our influence and military to pressure the Deuuyeuruhn government to accept annexation and military occupation to safeguard our citizens and their assets, while also asserting our dominance across the entire Diwvish Sea;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
