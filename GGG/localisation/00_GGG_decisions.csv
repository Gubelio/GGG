stack_upper_house_liberationist_desc;In recent months our executive agenda has been entirely stymied by the uncooperative legislature of our government, and the ruling party is unable to govern freely, and remake the nation in its image. After many contentious negotiations, it seems constitutionally possible that we could stack the upper house and create enough members such that we could force our own legislative agenda through the executive. However, this would be sure to cause massive political uproar. For while this isn’t strictly unconstitutional, it goes against the spirit of our laws, and all accepted political tradition. Those endorsing opposing ideologies are sure to be enraged, and we are sure to suffer some international humiliation as well for our untamed legislature. This would have to be carefully done, but it will allow us, on the other hand, to pass most reforms the current government feels are desperately needed for the health of the nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

embrace_shamush_desc;We peoples of Pruuntia have long languished in the shadow of the Poumnian empire. Our tongue is not far off from the Poumnians of the north, and indeed our kings, temples, and small principalities have long been considered tributary parts of their great celestial empire. But we are a different sort of folk than they. We are seafarers and fishermen, where they are a staid, agricultural people. We are joyous and free, where they are dour slaves of the empire. And for centuries our people have kept our own traditions and folkways around the ‘Shamush’ way, the awareness of the bicephalous serpentine spirits that knit the very world together, despite the presence of the imperial cult among our elites. But in recent years, more and more of our poets, our writers, even local princes themselves speak of Shamush lore, and above all what that means for one who would call themselves a Pruunt. For too long, cries on impassioned writer, we have languished under the cultural, political, and religious tyranny of the government of the Vopudwou. We should have our our faith, our own state, our own destiny, as the Pruuntish people! Proud, noble seafarers! It is we who first journeyed to Kovazh, many centuries ago. It is we who hunt the great bloated molluscs of the Diwvo depths, and trawl the thronging shoals of the western oceans. We are not Poumnians, we are Pruuntish people, and we follow the Shamush way! The government, it is said, should close the imperial temples, stop sending offerings to the capital, and above all, they should call the emperor not a god but a despot, if they wish to be a Pruuntish government. It is time we heard this call. To challenge the Poumnian empire like this would surely lead to a swift and terrible reaction from their large army - the empire has never been challenged in such away in recorded memory, and the cult of the Divine Vopudwou is the very foundation of their statehood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
form_pruuntawrish_title;Form Pruuntawrish;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
form_pruuntawrish_desc;There has never been in history a unified Pruuntish state. Long fractured amongst rival sea-lords, small ecclesiastical dominions, petty merchant republics, and above all tyrannized by the Poumnians to the north, our lands now lay for the first time in history unified, sovereign, and unbowed. It is we who challenged the Poumnian ‘elder brother’ and locked horns with the imperialist cause. Today, then, we proclaim the Pruuntawrish - the Pruuntish state. In a grand ceremony in $CAPITAL$, attended by the scions of the old naval houses, the merchant families, the Shamush teacher-priest dynasties, and above all the cheering populace, the minister of state proclaimed the formal adoption of this new name and the promulgation of a unified government for Pruunts everywhere. There will be many challenges ahead as we strive to fend for ourselves in the international political arena, but today is truly a momentous, perhaps the most momentous, day in Pruuntish history.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

embrace_shamush_peaceful_desc;Recent changes in the government of Poumnia have forced us to reflect on the religious constitution of our country. The dramatic overthrow of the Vopudwou, their celestial empire who is worshiped as a god, not only in their kingdom but all around the circle sea, into our Pruuntish lands, has shaken the very foundation of the world. We have many temples to the emperor, and most of our elites belong to the imperial cult, sending small offerings across the sea yearly to pray to his majesty. But now it seems we are at a loss for what to do - his majesty, it seems, is not God, but man. His kingdom fell and the rivers continued to run, and the sun continued to rise. In Poumnia many of their temples have been converted to messianic cults of a transcendent, unconquered and reborn world-spirit-emperor, but we in Pruuntia have our own indigenous faith, that of the ‘Shamush’ way. These esoteric folkways have been preserved by itinerant preachers, secretive religious schools, and village rites. Above all Shamush is almost less a faith, but a ‘way of seeing’. It might be prudent to dissociate our government from the dying empire, and publicly endorse Shamush rites for the first time in recorded memory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
the_ghan_gheecha_idea_title;The Ghan-Gheecha Idea;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
the_ghan_gheecha_idea_desc;We Byotrish have always been foreign to our neighbors. Tall, strong, and fast, we are not like those stout little fellows who came to live in the river and on the plateau and eastern plains. For indeed it was we who lived there long before those plateau men came with their boars from the east. The poets and bards sing of times of yore when we used to range across the vast plains, heroic warriors with sturdy frames, able to fight five of the stout and low men with ease. Now, though, it is not like this. Driven into the mountains, we live a complacent and impoverished life on the margins of civilization, while our racial brothers, our fellow Ghechan people, toil on the fields of the stout men in Poumnia and Gashdziik. How long must this state of affairs persist, lament our authors, our leaders, and indeed all those who have seen the suffering of the slaves of the lowlands? Shall we be blind to our fate? Nay! In recent years not only has our confederation gained material strength, political order, but the spirit of our people have been stirred to a new national consciousness of our racial destiny to right the wrongs of a 1000 years and liberate our brothers! This is the "the Ghan-Gheecha idea" - the unabashed birthright of the Ghechi, whether Byotrin, Anuvo, or Shagmodt!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
