post_napoleonic_army_doctrine;Gozomedic Army Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
post_napoleonic_army_doctrine_desc;The dynamic Greatlord of the eastern domains, Gozomedes Midodazh, at the outset of his reign, marshaled massive forces to begin an invasion of the rebellious and fractured imperial provinces. His army laws disrupted the traditional dynamic of noble officers leading the sons of their serfs into battle, and created some of the first true massive armies. The scale of tactics prompted a pivot to wars of dynamic movement, and grand battles, as well as logistical and officerial innovations as the military staff gained increasing flexibility and responsibility. His vastly effective armies, as demonstrated most spectacularly in the battle of Adnozhkt, against the combined forces of the southern alliance, demanded the large adoption of Gozomedic tactics and scales of arms by most of the foremost early states of Ishafazh in the early parts of the fourteenth century.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
field_fortifications;Field Fortifications;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
field_fortifications_desc;In the years following increasingly dynamic and grand battles, there were redoubled efforts to innovate in the area of fortifications and syngerise them with the dramatic mobile warfare of the early fourteenth century. Innovations accumulated in carefully positioned fortresses as well as trenching, embankments, and sappers embedded in units to provide shelter for mobile artillery positions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
railroad_transport_groups;Railroad Transport Corps;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
railroad_transport_groups_desc; The advent of the railroad and especially its proliferation in the fractious territories in the Great Nag encouraged the increased integration of civilian, military, and private railway organization in pursuit of military aims. Civilian and private entities worked closely with military authorities to ensure enough rolling stock for hasty mobilization, and timetables were communicated with the general staff; train conductors were either part of the soldiery or trained for mobilization patterns; and finally special transport corps were organized for embarking and disembarking on and from trains.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tank_expiriments;Two-Legger Experiments;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tank_expiriments_desc;The "Two Legger"ù was a late fourteenth century landship pioneered in the substantial war between the Great Nag and Poumnia. Consisting functionally of an combustion engine axel system that turns two massive front metal wheels supported by smaller auxiliary wheels at the back and a sheet metal skeleton, it features a back engine brig, a front gunnery hold to preserve a mounted artillery piece or machine gun, and a tall front cabin tower with a barred window for shooting and steering. The first and earliest two leggers saw service trundling across the shelled-out landscape of the frontlines in Dhuknag. Its narrow tall structure with massive wheels made it easy to steer, and less liable to get stuck in muddy terrain, and even ford through small swamps, but it was liable to tip if hit directly by shells.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tank_exploits;Two Legger Doctrines;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tank_exploits_desc;The early two legger deployments were usually clumsy or ill conceived. Two Leggers were hit by shells and toppled, their drivers were shot dead by daring soldiers who ran right up to them, or they simply stalled out from engine failure, rough terrain, or another mechanical issue. However, in the Nozo-Piikland battle of 1383, a trio of two leggers made a decisive difference in the fighting. Supported by infantry crews, a two legger charge with substantial firepower unleashed shattered Poumnian lines and drove the Poumnian position into a rout, eventually allowing the Jiishanagi forces to push the Poumnians back to the Piik river. From this point on, a number of doctrinal observances became associated with two legger combat: infantry support, and charge/ram maneuvers, primarily as a means for breaking tough positions. They began to feature spiked ramming pieces or grates towards the front of their chassis for annihilating those in their way. The two legger also became a curious tool for the gendarmeries, its fearsome image and armored shell protected the officers and soldiers from restive citizenry, and it was used as a mobile base of operations for regional occupation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tankette;Tracked Legs;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tankette_desc;The earlier two leggers featured primarily large, broad, metal wheels, which made for great agility in flat spaces, and long term reliability, requiring less maintenance, but also limited the size of the landship by weight, forcing engineers to install smaller artillery pieces and machine guns. However, the use of tracking for specialized mobile heavy artillery installations made for the possibility of designing two leggers with far greater firepower and armor. Treading also made them more resilient to irregular terrain in mountains and hilly settings. The first combat ready tracked Two Legger, "Baztakoi"ù, Namanak Dodazh's "mobile fortress"ù, was deployed late in the Nagi-Poumnian war in 1386, and saw combat as a fortress buster in the scree ridden muddy hills of Pouromum.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
light_tank;Heavy Leggers;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
light_tank_desc; The substantial increase in tonnage allowed by tracks allowed for not only a substantial increase in size and firepower in the design of traditional two leggers, but allowed for a substantial revision in design. The traditional steering cabin tower was moved to the center, but the engine brig was also expanded to include a crew quarters for carrying infantry, and the frontal artillery installations were expanded and improved. The "mobile fortress"ù of the later Nagi-Poumian war was a fearsome installation on a strategic position in a battlefield, which came to be a central fixture of late fourteenth century and early fifteenth century warfare.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
armored_cars;Two Legger Support Crews;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
armored_cars_desc;With the invention of larger and treaded two leggers, the heavy wear and tear on the treads, and more intensive engine usage made them less reliable, and oftentimes they would be towed by tractor to battle sites, rather than consistently driven across long distances, and supported by active infantry crews trained to fight alongside two leggers. The presence of regular support crews for larger two leggers led to their gradual adoption by the smaller two legger crews as well, in a limited way. Integration within infantry units trained to right two leggers helped deal with stability, and a ledge for sappers to rest on at the back of the two legger allowed for quick mobilization of duckboards and digging of gullies to traverse vastly irregular terrain in non-combat settings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
late_enlightenment_philosophy;Practical Realism and Subjectivism;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idealism;Functionalism;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
neokantian_idealism;Ashkazhine Functionalism;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
neokantian_idealism_desc;It is undoubtedly clear, declared Opau Ashkazh, in The Functional Account of Being (1302), a foundational text of the mechanist Ashkazhine epistemology and ontology, is that things exist because they do things, and what they do is the totality of their being. They are mere "machines"ù working on other machines. One cannot conceive of even the impression of an object save for the capacity of the object to act upon the mind. In such a way, the mind, the body, and all "things"ù, the "thing"ù label now extended also to processes, words, and ideas, for these similarly have affective capacity, are merely acting and receiving machines, both affective and pathetic. This broadly synthetic and systematizing work would be followed by substantial revisions and elaborations by Ashkazh's students and Ashkazh himself, and would dominate the intellectual climate of Ishahfazh in the first half of the fourteenth century.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hegelian_idealism;Pragmatics and Linguistics;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hegelian_idealism_desc;The posit of words as processes by which a subject acts, not as signifiers, gradually revolutionized the study of language. Drawing on the work of Ashkazhine functionalism and the parts of it devoted to philosophical and linguistic discourse, Ishagiza Bohdma in The Empirical Study of Word Usage and Translation (1320), gives a broad theoretical and ontological account of the functions of words and their systematic orderings as functional modes of speech, incorporating older notions of the grammarians such as the indicative and the imperative.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
proto_existentialism;Ultranominalism;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
proto_existentialism_desc; The advent of a linguistic paradigm that fully excluded any commitments to suppository or significatory features came to resurrect an old debate in metaphysics. Practically, argues, Rukroum Betz-Ohrun, in The Wallaby's* Tail (1315), an asemantic language fails to commit us to, not just categories or universals, but even particulars. A divergence from Ashkazhine functionalism, who believes we can talk of the machines that work, Betz-Ohrun and his school, drawing on a already restrictive epistemological system, came to believe that while words can be used to cause other to believe in entities, they do not actually speak of classes or entities or indicate classes or entities. *Meaning a large rodential creature found in Pruuntia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

enlightenment_thought;Anti-Magisterialism;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
paternalism;Paternalism;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
paternalism_desc;Paternalistic attitudes have historically been popular in various parts of Ishafazhi society; patronage, lordship, bonds of social clientage, wala, etc. have been prevailing attitudes and implicit structural relationships that have ordered the relations between those considered social betters and social inferiors. Anti-Magisterial and Liberationist speculation broadly reinforced these ideas, either from a perspective of governmental responsibility for guaranteeing liberties, or, in a reactionary context, reaffirming the preferable relationship of lordly patronage as opposed to yeomanry and peasant freedom. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
constitutionalism;Rustic Naturalism;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
constitutionalism_desc;The speculation of the anti-magisterial movement led to a broad endorsement of rusticism and naturalism in political economy. Championing peasant agrarianism as "natural state of affairs"ù and particularist rural communitarianism as the perfect form of social organization, liberationist texts such as Dhov (Lord) Bozzamogga Nozkazh's Man and Nature and Madha Bidazh's Programme for the Shapt County Harvest popularized these political ideals. In many parts of the world the proliferation of these texts encouraged peasant militancy and regional organization, such as rural land banks, local assemblies, and a blending of the social and the political community in the countryside.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
atheism;Congregationalism;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
atheism_desc;Liberationist and anti-magisterial speculation and political agitation broadly endorsed rural congregationalism as an ideal for the relationship between faith and social organization. Dencouning state involvement in ecclesiastical organization, political and religious activists beginning in the Gashdzii realms began to champion religious self-organization. Self-conscious religious organizations broadly had the effect of increasing social solidarity in regional communities, and reinforcing a sense of local and cultural identity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
egalitarianism;Fraternity;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
egalitarianism_desc;Early liberationist writing implicitly lauded a certain sort of patriarchal masculine fraternity among the yeomen class, but later liberationist writers, notably Yathoon Ifo in An Enquiry into the Origins of Nations came to construe "fraternity"ù, understood as an exclusive, ostensibly ultimately racial and brotherly, covenant of male yeomen who would fight, farm, and pray, autonomously but voluntarily together, as constituting the only legitimate foundation of nationhood. Extended so into the political sphere, "national fraternity"ù came to dominate the political discourse, especially in the revolutionary and free-yoker political contexts. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
rationalism;The Sovereign Will;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
rationalism_desc;"The Sovereign Will"ù as an idealization of a resolved social covenant between voluntarily free citizens pooling their natural sovereignty endowed to them by nature, land-ownership, and strength ultimately became the rational basis for Liberationist governance. A tension in liberationist philosophy between the professed sovereignty of the individual, his (for ultimately the only political subject for the liberationist was a male) implicit relationship with the community, and the paradoxical need to construct a government to demarcate the limits of government always plagued liberationist speculation. These contradictions were ultimately resolved by Sevu Orooth in his influential synthesis Three forms of Mortal Governance, where, in the third part, he describes "the perfect [or divine - Sithevan makes no distinction] community"ù (Bo Yethu Anitoro), government by the sovereign will that preserves both communal liberty and individual liberty, both of which ultimately are free to then constitute a harmonized will by a self-conscious identification with its preserving faculties, the "benign circle' that is "the hand that holds itself"ù, in Orooth's words.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ideological_thought;Political Dogma;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
authoritarianism_desc;The liberationist outburst stimulated the vigorous and self-conscious reformation and clarification of epistemological and practical principles by conservative and reactionary thinkers. Rallying behind the capacity for violence and naked force of reactionary armies, the clerical and municipal police, and the hangman's gallows, many defenders of the old order have come to champion the state's power to control as the foundation of its right to existence and right to command the lives of subjects. In the Modhag Police Commissioners Handbook of 1311, Arch Constable (Jakozzak) Vazzamak Nazakh lays out a plethora of methods for control of the populace, including closed juries, secret informants, penal labour colonies, mock-executions, and spectacular public violence, as well as provides short and practical justifications for the "maintenance of order and the foundations of the laws"ù.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hierarchical_order;Romantic Servitude and Social Corporatism;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hierarchical_order_desc;The context into which industrial society sprung was not an early modern context with a feeble public sphere, but a basically premodern cognitive context. The reactionary psychology was deeply rooted in ideas of personal servitude to a local master, whether the district governor of a Poumnian Inu (Imperial Province), the local Dhov (Lord) in the feudatories of Gashdiik, or the rootsman of the northern Tehurites. In a context of increasing literacy and political debate, in the 1310s and onward one sees a proliferation of public and private texts glorifying the romantic nation of service to another or the (exclusive) community; the bond between lord and master, comradeship in armies, and thrilling sublimity of adapting one's being entirely to the faithful service of a greater power. The gubernatorial oath of the Gozonazhk polity composed in about 1313 is a prime example of the adaption of romantic service to new context. Pledging strict loyalty, body and soul, the candidate is expected to prosecute his duties as governor of cities and provinces, "were he but a limb of the powers that be, the crown, estates, and parliament"ù.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
traditionalism;Parochialism;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
traditionalism_desc;Self conscious and dogmatized parochialism gained currency as a political ideal in the early fourteenth century. Amenable to both the needs of Liberationists and Conservatives, ideological parochialism champions the immediate and the local, the family, the village, the court, the manor, as the natural organization of society. All political life is seen as the outgrowth of family life, and this is seen best kept as a small and local affair. Drawing on a vast collection of clerical and monarchical propaganda texts throughout history, the acme of this political development came with Dosh Modo of the Guzzadt Chruch in Gaub's The Care of Souls (1315), a synthetic work on the ways to goodness and salvation, which incorporates vast amounts of discourse on the role of the state, family, community, and the prince as the "little father"ù, proxy of the mother Guzzadt, in a reality rife with religious order and significance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
political_religion;The Divine Community;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
political_religion_desc;The success of the Liberationist experiment in Sublime Veyethu after the revolution of 1297 planted a particular Vugiorian brand on Liberationist and Free Yoker discourse. Originally, of course, the Liberationist thought was an outgrowth of social-magisterialism, and the emphasis on freedom of congregational organization remained a cornerstone of Liberationist philosophy, but the Veyethian state took the extreme position of covering much of its political decisions with appeals to "natural theology"ù, "the numinal will"ù, and "the sacrosanct order"ù. Even in non-vewugist contexts, Liberationist demands became intimately involved in, and made with appeal to, religious discourse and concepts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
individualism;Antietiologism;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
individualism_desc;A strange and short-lived doctrinal flourishing the Vokonazhi domains, Antietiologism was a fascination of the reclusive and esoteric literary intelligentsia. It emphasizes not the free will of all individuals, but specifically champions the senselessness of notions of cause, motion, behavior, and suggests that all action is both uncaused, and unwilled. Demanding a shift to the "psychology of the steppe"ù, this being a period of fascination with the Hyundaatv of northern Bafozh, it attacks both the liberationist movement and conservatism positing an absence of meaning to both of their structures. Practically, it would encourage greater political disobedience and unorthodox thought in the academy. Its foundational text was Ishahmedes Doshkazhk's Will, Anti-Will, and Unwill (1322), a concise discourse on the concept of willing, and its ramifications in ethics, politics, and aesthetics. The reverberations of Antietiologism would be subtle but persistent, narrowly affecting political discourse, but spawning a degree of aesthetic and literary responses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
secularization;Secularization;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
secularization_desc;The advent of modern economic structures, increasing literacy, and the unorthodox liberationist employment of religious discourse encouraged a conceptual distinction between the city of god and the city of man. Once embedded in a common social habitus in most parts of the world, a key feature of the modern mind was this conceptual distinction and the possibility of the construction of secular subjecthood. Drawing on the work of various heterodox historical commentators on the matter, social thinkers and political dogmatists, such as Shomoho Mudt and Drid Tzau-Hydom began to advocate for a secular ideal. The secular impulse would undergird the demands for Statism and the formation of the Statist ideology.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
determinism;Political Functionalism;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
determinism_desc;Functionalist philosophy eventually found its way to the field of social and political speculation. In Shomoho Mudt's Social and Political Being (1319), Mudt declares there is nothing "given"ù about the state or the community save for that one of its functions is typically to perpetuate its own existence - a new, better state may be made by systems working within it, and the test of the state is merely its ability to "operate"ù. Mudt's work would be foundational in the clarification of Statist political organization, as well as their revolutionary dogma.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
